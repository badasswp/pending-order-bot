Send reminders on WooCommerce pending orders.

== Installation ==

1. Go to 'Plugins > Add New' on your WordPress admin dashboard.
2. Search for 'Pending Order Bot' plugin from the official WordPress plugin repository.
3. Click 'Install Now' and then 'Activate'.

== Description ==

The average cart abandonment rate is <strong>69.99%</strong>, according to Baymard Institute. This is an average of 48 shopping cart abandonment studies, which range from 56% to 81%.

The middle point of just under a <strong>70%</strong> cart abandonment rate means that only <strong>three out of ten customers</strong> who fill their shopping carts <strong>actually make it to checkout</strong> to complete their purchase.

This plugin helps remind customers of their abandoned cart orders, so they complete their purchases. It's that simple!

= âœ¨ Getting Started =

1. Head off to Twilio.com to sign up to get an account.
2. Locate the Console page in the Twilio website and get your Account SID and Token.
3. Fill your plugin options page with your Twilio details and enable the <strong>Send Text</strong> and <strong>Send E-mail</strong> options.
4. You're all set!
5. WooCommerce users should now get reminders on abandoned cart orders.
