2. Search for 'Pending Order Bot' plugin from the official WordPress plugin repository.

== Description ==

The average cart abandonment rate is <strong>69.99%</strong>, according to Baymard Institute. This is an average of 48 shopping cart abandonment studies, which range from 56% to 81%.

The middle point of just under a <strong>70%</strong> cart abandonment rate means that only <strong>three out of ten customers</strong> who fill their shopping carts <strong>actually make it to checkout</strong> to complete their purchase.

This plugin helps remind customers of their abandoned cart orders, so they complete their purchases. It's that simple!
